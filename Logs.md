Pledged to the #100daysofMLCode. This will serve as the Journal for the entire 100 Days.

# Objectives:
* Learn what ML is and its implications to society

* Be able to create one project broken into 30 Days:
        * Obtaining data set and working with Data
        * Creating a model from the given data
        * <Unknown> Will have to figure this out
* Have fun and more importantly learn to give 1-2 hours a day for this cause.
