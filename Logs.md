# 100DaysOfML
Pledged to the #100daysofMLCode. This will serve as the Journal for the entire 100 Days.

## Objectives:
* Learn what ML is and its implications to society
* Resume the free couse in Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning
* Create scratch works and learn about tools used for ML (SKlearn etc.) # Will figure this out.
* Be able to create one project broken into 30 Days:
       - Obtaining data set and working with Data
       - Creating a model from the given data
       - <Unknown> Will have to figure this out

## Note to self
Have fun and more importantly learn to give 1-2 hours a day for this cause.
I already work 8+ Hours a day for others. 1-2 hours dedicated for this is relatively small.:joy:
  
 
## Start of the logs

### Day 1: July 7, 2018
First of all what is Machine Learning?
From reddit's [ELI5:Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4v3u4l/eli5_what_is_machine_learning/) what I learned is that machine learning is a way to program a computer in a way that it would be able to figure something out without you typing it in **rule based, multiple if statements**. You would then **TRAIN** the machine to provide an output by feeding it data. The more data you have the more the machine can get the context of what you are trying to achieve. As it feeds on more data the more complex the things it can come up with.

Reading an article from [Medium](https://medium.com/@lampix/machine-learning-ml-and-its-impact-on-humanity-71d041298ac) about ML's impact on humanity. It is very exciting to know what machine learning is changing on the fields we know today. Imagine how different and exciting it would be when we reach the point where the things our machine learning models discover today becomes the input to the machine learnings we are about to have. The possibilities. Its exciting. :grinning:
 
### Day 2: July 8, 2018

Continuing now on the Intro to Machine Learning course by Udacity. I started this when I was in Thailand last June 2. I am already in Lesson 2: Naive Bayes but I had to pause because my Python was still crappy, it still is but I have finished the Intro to Python and I promise to code and practice more every day. With this initiative, I sure am going to be coding for a while. :smiley:

Anyway, the lesson for today is Gaussian Naive Bayes. The documentation as well as sample code for [Gaussian Naive Bayes in SKlearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) is in this link.  What is Naive Bayes anyway? From [Medium](https://medium.com/@gp_pulipaka/applying-gaussian-na%C3%AFve-bayes-classifier-in-python-part-one-9f82aa8d9ec4) it says:
>Primarily NaÃ¯ve Bayes is a linear classifier, which is a supervised machine learning method and works as a probabilistic classifier as well.

The article was very technical for me to wrap my head around. So I went to reddit [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1p4r3e/eli5_naive_bayes_classifier/). So Naive Bayes is a **Classifier**, this is the first thing. From the reddit answer:
>classifiers is a way to use **MATH** to identify something.

Now on to the Bayes part. For readings on [Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes). Basically, Bayes was the guy who formulated the theories of statistics and probabilty we now know as [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem). *Side note: This was also the hardest section of the Mathematics exam for the Boards.  :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:*
Going deeper into Bayes' theorem you will get the concept that:
>Bayes' Theorem can give probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions realted to the event

The closest example I can think of here that could be related is duck-typing. If it loos like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. That goes without saying that you NEED to have prior idea of how a duck walks, looks and quacks.

I have also tried the example outlined in the SKlearn documentation. The code is in 'GNB-SKLearn.py'.

### Day 3: July 9, 2018

I am currenlty having multiple projects at once. The Deep Learning nanodgree in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) is starting this July 10 and I am enrolled. This #100DaysOfMLCode would be a great supplement to track my progress in the nano-degree. I enrolled because I am becoming more interested to pursue the field of AI. I am interested in knowing more and I would like to enter the field and contribute. This would be part of my life long learning initiative. This was paid with the money I saved up as *Education Funds*:thumbsup:

In terms of progress for today, I was able to continue watching UD120. It is helpful but I also found the [crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) in Google Developers helpful. Although I have just finished watching the Intro and Framing, if the course structure is the same then I would recommend this course better than the one in Udacity. The crash course has some reading parts which I can follow along which I -PERSONALLY- prefer.

Reading over the crash course, there is a prerequisites page and a poll on your current background in ML. Since I am starting from zero background I have to go over the entire course in the order it is placed. Additionally, there are some recommended prerequisites to the course to better aid the understanding and the pace of the course:
* Intro-level Algebra - Which was already covered in college so I just need to review  :tada:
* Proficiency in programming basics, and some experience coding in Python -  :muscle: should be manageable since I have some expreience in coding and I just finished the Intro to Python Course :satisfied:. I might need to grasp the Tensorflow workflow but that should be manageable.

I also modified the SKlearn example on Gaussian Naive Bayes. This might seem like I am all over the place by starting up a lot but once I get into the rythm and focus on the course this journal would have more structure. To circle back to the modification in SKlearn code, I tried adding a sort of story on the data, the idea is that the data collected were taken from the test for drug use. More on this is already documented in the 'GNB-SKlearn.py' code.
