# 100DaysOfML
Pledged to the #100daysofMLCode. This will serve as the Journal for the entire 100 Days.

## Objectives:
* Learn what ML is and its implications to society
* Resume the free couse in Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning
* Create scratch works and learn about tools used for ML (SKlearn etc.) # Will figure this out.
* Be able to create one project broken into 30 Days:
       - Obtaining data set and working with Data
       - Creating a model from the given data
       - <Unknown> Will have to figure this out

## Note to self
Have fun and more importantly learn to give 1-2 hours a day for this cause.
I already work 8+ Hours a day for others. 1-2 hours dedicated for this is relatively small.:joy:

### Day 1: July 7,2018
First of all what is Machine Learning?
From reddit's [ELI5:Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4v3u4l/eli5_what_is_machine_learning/) what I learned is that machine learning is a way to program a computer in a way that it would be able to figure something out without you typing it in **rule based, multiple if statements**. You would then **TRAIN** the machine to provide an output by feeding it data. The more data you have the more the machine can get the context of what you are trying to achieve. As it feeds on more data the more complex the things it can come up with.

Reading an article from [Medium](https://medium.com/@lampix/machine-learning-ml-and-its-impact-on-humanity-71d041298ac) about ML's impact on humanity. It is very exciting to know what machine learning is changing on the fields we know today. Imagine how different and exciting it would be when we reach the point where the things our machine learning models discover today becomes the input to the machine learnings we are about to have. The possibilities. Its exciting. :grinning:
 
### Day 2: July 8,2018

Continuing now on the Intro to Machine Learning course by Udacity. I started this when I was in Thailand last June 2. I am already in Lesson 2: Naive Bayes but I had to pause because my Python was still crappy, it still is but I have finished the Intro to Python and I promise to code and practice more every day. With this initiative, I sure am going to be coding for a while. :smiley:

Anyway, the lesson for today is Gaussian Naive Bayes. The documentation as well as sample code for [Gaussian Naive Bayes in SKlearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) is in this link.  What is Naive Bayes anyway? From [Medium](https://medium.com/@gp_pulipaka/applying-gaussian-na%C3%AFve-bayes-classifier-in-python-part-one-9f82aa8d9ec4) it says:
>Primarily NaÃ¯ve Bayes is a linear classifier, which is a supervised machine learning method and works as a probabilistic classifier as well.
The article was very technical for me to wrap my head around. So I went to reddit [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1p4r3e/eli5_naive_bayes_classifier/). So Naive Bayes is a **Classifier**, this is the first thing. From the reddit answer:
>classifiers is a way to use **MATH** to identify something.
Now on to the Bayes part. For readings on [Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes). Basically, Bayes was the guy who formulated the theories of statistics and probabilty we now know as [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem). *Side note: This was also the hardest section of the Mathematics exam for the Boards.  :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:*
Going deeper into Bayes' theorem you will get the concept that:
>Bayes' Theorem can give probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions realted to the event
The closest example I can think of here that could be related is duck-typing. If it loos like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. That goes without saying that you NEED to have prior idea of how a duck walks, looks and quacks.

I have also tried the example outlined in the SKlearn documentation. The code is in 'GNB-SKLearn.py'.
