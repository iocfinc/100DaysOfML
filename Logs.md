# 100DaysOfML
Pledged to the #100daysofMLCode. This will serve as the Journal for the entire 100 Days.

## Objectives:
* Learn what ML is and its implications to society
* Resume the free couse in Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning
* Create scratch works and learn about tools used for ML (SKlearn etc.) # Will figure this out.
* Be able to create one project broken into 30 Days:
       - Obtaining data set and working with Data
       - Creating a model from the given data
       - <Unknown> Will have to figure this out

## Note to self
Have fun and more importantly learn to give 1-2 hours a day for this cause.
I already work 8+ Hours a day for others. 1-2 hours dedicated for this is relatively small.:joy:

 ### Day 1: July 7,2018
First of all what is Machine Learning?
From reddit's [ELI5:Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4v3u4l/eli5_what_is_machine_learning/) what I learned is that machine learning is a way to program a computer in a way that it would be able to figure something out without you typing it in **rule based, multiple if statements**. You would then **TRAIN** the machine to provide an output by feeding it data. The more data you have the more the machine can get the context of what you are trying to achieve. As it feeds on more data the more complex the things it can come up with.

Reading an article from [Medium](https://medium.com/@lampix/machine-learning-ml-and-its-impact-on-humanity-71d041298ac) about ML's impact on humanity. It is very exciting to know what machine learning is changing on the fields we know today. Imagine how different and exciting it would be when we reach the point where the things our machine learning models discover today becomes the input to the machine learnings we are about to have. The possibilities. Its exciting. :grinning:
