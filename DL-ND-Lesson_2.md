# Lesson 2: Applying Deep Learning

The main idea in this lesson was to let us try examples of Deep Learning applications and the projects we can look forward to as we go along in the course. The models here are already pre-trained and are availabe in Github. They basically want us to have fun and play around models of deep learning.

## Style transfer

For this topic there we were able to _copy_ the styles in known works of art and apply them to an example picture we have. This being the initial setup of my environment I experienced a lot of errors in getting the model to work. I still have to figure out if there is a way to actually setup a virtual environment for a project without actually re-downloading the modules. Those modules could add up eventually and eat up space and they seem to be repetitive. For now I am using the base environment in Anaconda. I added tensorflow and some other modules that were causing an error in this exercise. One thing of note that was highlighted here is that many of the codes or contents will eventually have issues. Obviously not all dependecies can be considered (this is a good idea to use virtual env so that we can audit which modules are actually needed). Even if there are issues, the internet will always be available for questions. Plus there is the Slack community and the mentor. It's simply about taking the time to find out or reach out to the correct person.

Circling back to the topic here are the results of my Style Transfer attempt:

## Deep traffic

This example simulates driving in traffic and using deep learning to make decisions. Its quite interesting and it can be accessed in [here](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/). Its quite fun actually to spend time here and try to optimize the parameters to create a neural network that can drive the car as fast as possible through the highway.

Here is the result I got with the following parameters:

## Flappy Bird Game

There is also a pre-trained model to play Flappy bird.
